# Angled Button Documentation

Original source: [https://utsa-asc.github.io/college-dls/college-dls/reference/navigation-standard.html#standard-button-wrapper](https://utsa-asc.github.io/college-dls/college-dls/reference/navigation-standard.html#standard-button-wrapper)

These angled buttons are used in higher order components like [Action Cards](action-card--default) and [CTAs](call-to-action-buttons--default)

## Supported Variants

Currently, angled buttons are only supported in the two major UTSA colors, orange and blue.  There are not plans at this point to implement a variant for white or grey colors. 

- Default: Orange button with light white angled arrow end
- Blue: Blue button with light white angled arrow end
- Large: A larger format button, this variant also supports blue and orange colors

Like [Button](/college-dls/components/detail/button.html), usage should avoid placing a orange/blue button on the same color background.  Placing a color button on a same color background will force the button to change to an alternate color as seen above.
