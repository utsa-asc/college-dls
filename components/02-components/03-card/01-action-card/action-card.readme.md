# About Action Card

The Action Card is a smaller level component and is not designed to be used stand-alone.

Please see the corresponding [Content Group](action-group) components to use a component of this type.

# Guidance

## When to use the action card component

You should use an action card component when you are looking to add a three-column layout with an image, headline, description, and link. 

## When to consider something else

If one of the requirements above isn't met, it's suggested that you use another layout/component. 

# Accessibility Notes
Please ensure the image has appropriate alt text, and the link is descriptive. Please refrain from using "Click here" or "Learn more" for the link text.

# Using the Action Card component

This component is supported in our Cascade templates via the **Asset Factory: Blocks > Action Card Group** and can be assigned in a page template at the row level.
# Component Variants

There is a variant for [Headings Only](action-card--heading) where the description is not included. Only use this if the other action cards in the group do not use a description, so they are all consistent. 

## Media Requirements

- Action Card Image:  Our standard image size is 460px (width) by 210px (height), 72 ppi (pixels per inch) jpeg or png.
    - Image should be no larger than 300kb (kilobytes)

## Copy Requirements

Each action card is composed of the following elements:

- Headline: A brief sentence 
    - Keep the length of this text consistent across all your action cards to avoid an unbalanced look
- Text: a brief paragraph 
    - Keep the length of this text consistent across all your action cards to avoid an unbalanced look
- Link Label: Descriptive text on where the user will be linked to. Try to avoid the link text from wrapping.
