## Implementation Notes

This is a smaller level component and is not designed to be used stand alone.  TODO: Create a separate preview template for this component to pop into a col-3 or col-4 width size.

The Contact Callout is designed to be placed at the bottom of a sidebar or as a postfix to content, for a working example see the [Reference - Department Secondary Page](department-secondary-page--default)
