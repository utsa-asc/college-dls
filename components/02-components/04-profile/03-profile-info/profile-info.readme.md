# About Profile Info
The profile info component is designed to display quick information for a faculty member. 

For an example of this section-level component in action, please see the [Faculty Profile Page](https://utsa-asc.github.io/college-dls/components/detail/faculty-profile-page.html)
## Guidance

### When you use the profile info component
This component would be best used on a faculty profile page, so the user can see information about the faculty member. 

### When to consider something else
The information is best on a faculty profile page, but other components have brief information about the faculty member. Some of the other components to use for quick details are the following:
- Profile Card 
- Contact Callout
- Faculty Bio

Please use one of the above if you don't have enough information for a faculty profile page. 
## Accessibility Notes
Please make sure to add proper alt text to the profile image that clearly explains who the person is. Also, if linking to a PDF for the CV, make sure the document is accessible.
