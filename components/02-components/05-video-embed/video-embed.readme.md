# About Video Embed
Web component that renders YouTube and Vimeo embeds faster. We utilize [@justinribeiro/lite-youtube](https://github.com/justinribeiro/lite-youtube) and [@slightlyoff/lite-vimeo](https://github.com/slightlyoff/lite-vimeo) to accomplish this task.

This web component can be used inside WYSIWYG boxes, but is also utilized by larger components like the [Call to Action - Media](call-to-action-media--video).
