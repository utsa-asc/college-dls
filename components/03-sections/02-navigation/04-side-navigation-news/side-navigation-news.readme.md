## Implementation Notes

The Side-Navigation-News sidebar is intended to provide users with info related to the current news article they are reading.  Utilized by subfolders within a college site (think internal department pages). For examples of correct usage of this component, please see any of the [Reference Pages](department-secondary-page).
