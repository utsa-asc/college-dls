# Site-Footer Documentation

Adopting the look and feel of the existing Cascade CMS Seed Template site ankle section.  For a good example of this one, take a look at [UTSA Student Affairs](https://utsa.edu/students).

## Design and Code

This section utilizes existing bootstrap classes for layout and simple FontAwesome icons for social media graphics.  No custom classes should be needed.  The background color should not be changed to remain consistent across UTSA web properties.

## Type of information

The site footer is the last chance for presenting site contact information (College address, phone, email, etc).  It should be standard to include this immediately before the global UTSA footer.  An exception for not displaying this footer can be made for custom landing pages or one pagers.
