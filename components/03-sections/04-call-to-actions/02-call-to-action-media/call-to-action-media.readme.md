Original source from [https://utsa-asc.github.io/college-dls/college-dls/reference/functional.html#call-highlight-component](https://utsa-asc.github.io/college-dls/college-dls/reference/functional.html#call-highlight-component)
## Implementation Notes

Like the [CTA](call-to-action-buttons), this component is designed to be full-width (Section) and has a short headline and optional short message.  The focus here is on the action button.  In addition, this component allows for either a right or left sided image.  

## Media Requirements
CTA Media Image: Our standard image size is 600px (width) by 400px (height), 72 ppi (pixels per inch) jpeg or png.

Image should be no larger and 300kb (kilobytes)
