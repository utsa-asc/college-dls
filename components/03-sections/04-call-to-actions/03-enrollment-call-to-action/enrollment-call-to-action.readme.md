## Implementation Notes

The enrollment CTA was designed to be utilized in templates at the very bottom of every page directly before any site and global footer.  For users that make it to this part of the page, it utilizes our three main CTA for enrollment audiences.

This component is designed to be a full-width (Section).  There is one college variation [enrollment-call-to-action--college](enrollment-call-to-action--college) for pages/sites that may need more college focused CTA wording.

## Media Requirements
- Enrollment CTA Image: Our standard image size is 1600px (width) by 500px (height), 72 ppi (pixels per inch) jpeg or png.

    - Image should be no larger than 300kb (kilobytes)
