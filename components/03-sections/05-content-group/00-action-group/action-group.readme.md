# Action Group Documentation

Original source from [https://utsa-asc.github.io/college-dls/college-dls/reference/card-tiles.html#content-card](https://utsa-asc.github.io/college-dls/college-dls/reference/card-tiles.html#content-card)
## Implementation Notes

Please ensure all the content is consistent (image, heading, blurb, link), otherwise an Action Group may look unbalanced. Please see the [Action Card Component](action-card--default) for additional documentation. 

All Content Group level components are designed to be full width. Depending on the size of the content and images, you may utilize 3 or 4 internal card components within a row.

## Media Requirements
Action Card Image: Our standard image size is 460px (width) by 210px (height), 72 ppi (pixels per inch) jpeg or png.

Image should be no larger and 300kb (kilobytes)
