## Implementation Notes

All Content Group level components are designed to be full width. Unlike the other group components, each internal card component here is full-width, creating a vertical stack of components.  A variation supporting a corresponding image is also available.

## Media Requirements
Action Card Image: Our standard image size is 460px (width) by 210px (height), 72 ppi (pixels per inch) jpeg or png.

Image should be no larger and 300kb (kilobytes)
