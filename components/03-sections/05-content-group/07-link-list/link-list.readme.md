## Implementation Notes

This full-width component is design to provide a clear two-column format for list item.  For an example of this component in action, please see the [Reference - Institute Home Page](institute-home-page)

# Using the Link List

This component is supported in our Cascade templates via the WYSIWYG by creating an unordered (bullet) list of linked items then clicking on the list and going to **Formats > Custom > Link List**.
