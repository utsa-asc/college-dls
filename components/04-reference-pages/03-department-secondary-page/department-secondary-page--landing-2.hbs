            <p>Our accounting program is designed to prepare students to thrive in any number of careers within this
              increasingly complex and challenging profession. Our program maintains high standards and is separately
              accredited by AACSB, the premier business accrediting agency.</p>
            <p>At the undergraduate level, the department offers the traditional four-year accounting major as well as
              the 150-hour professional accounting major.</p>
            <p>In this program, the degree plan for the BBA in Accounting is combined with that of the Master of
              Accountancy. The advantage of this program is that it allows accounting majors to spread the graduate
              courses required for the MS degree over the fourth and fifth years of the 150-hour program. Upon
              successful completion of the 150-hour program, students will be simultaneously awarded both degrees and
              will be eligible to sit for the CPA exam.</p>
            <p>At the graduate level, the department offers a Master of Accountancy degree as well as a Ph.D.
              concentration in accounting. Level up your career with a Master of Accountancy degree that combines
              foundational knowledge with focus areas in audit, data analytics/information security and taxation.</p>
            <p>Non-degree-seeking students may not enroll in accounting courses beyond Principles of Accounting I (ACC
              2013) and Principles of Accounting II (ACC 2033). Please contact Undergraduate Advising to declare an
              undergraduate major in accounting or Graduate</p>
