            <h6>How has COVID affected your studies or you personally this semester?</h6>
            <p>COVID has affected my studies in a positive fw-light throughout this semester. It has taught me that
              digital communication is extremely important and necessary throughout times like this, and it has made
              me more proficient in learning a variety of software such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams to name a few.</p>

            <h6>What have you learned most from your program of study thus far?</h6>
            <p>I have learned from my program of study that certifications and learning numerous technological skills
              can make a significant impact when looking for jobs post-graduation. This is not a field if you want to
              relax and spend your days doing nothing. Technology is constantly evolving and needs individuals ready
              to put in the work to keep online databases secure and away from breach, and the program at UTSA has
              taught me to strive for success in the field of technology.</p>

            <h6>Any organizations or activities that you’ve been involved with in the COB or at UTSA?</h6>
            <p>I was a College of Business senator in the Student Government Association where I acted as a liaison
              for business students who demanded to see change through on-campus life. I was a volunteer coordinator
              for the Hunger and Homelessness Movement where I contacted different organizations throughout San
              Antonio in order to coordinate times for students to seek volunteer opportunities, whether it be through
              homeless shelters, soup kitchens and nonprofit church organizations. I am currently co-president of the
              same organization where we strive to oversee the other officers who are completing their daily tasks as
              well as keeping volunteers encouraged throughout busy semesters. I am also a member of the Computer
              Security Association as well as the CompTIA Student Chapter where security undergraduates are given
              helpful tips and information on how certifications are important for technology professionals.</p>

            <h6>What are you watching, reading or listening to right now?</h6>
            <p>I am currently watching Forensic Files along with reading The Cuckoo’s Egg, a story following an
              international hacker who is attempting to breach military bases throughout North America. The
              protagonist is an astronomer working at a computer lab who is attempting to find and prevent the
              attacker from causing any more damage to top-secret American bases.</p>

            <h6>Professional work experience or internships that you’ve participated in?</h6>
            <p>I am currently a management information systems intern for Digital Defense, Inc. where I set up
              Reconnaissance Network Appliances for potential clients that need them, as well as creating RSE domains
              for acquiring companies. In the summer of 2021 I will be a technical delivery manager intern for Pearson
              where I will oversee technical projects within the company as well as learn how to better maneuver cloud
              applications.</p>

            <h6>What are your future career plans?</h6>
            <p>My future career plans are to design a top-of-the-line security system that has never been created. I
              want to develop everything from scratch. I also want to eventually attain an executive position for a
              security company and become proficient in cloud infrastructure as well as other types of cloud
              applications.</p>
